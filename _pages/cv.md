Lifelong Research Objective
======
My research objective is to develop human-centered AI systems that bridge the gap between complex AI technologies and end-users. I focus on creating intuitive interfaces that empower professionals across specialized domains, particularly in biology and law, to effectively harness AI capabilities. By emphasizing user experience design and creative interaction patterns, I aim to unlock AI’s potential to generate novel insights while ensuring accessibility and practical value. My work ultimately seeks to advance AI applications that meaningfully benefit both individuals and society.

Research Interest
======
I investigate innovative approaches to enhance natural language processing systems, with particular emphasis on dialogue summarization, controlled text generation, and domain-specific applications. My research integrates knowledge graphs, data augmentation strategies, and reward modeling to improve AI performance and reliability. By combining theoretical advances with practical implementations, I develop solutions that address real-world challenges while fostering creative problem-solving. This work contributes to both fundamental NLP research and its practical applications across diverse professional domains.
